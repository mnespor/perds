# Perds

Haply this is the immutable collections library you need. Work with frozen arrays and objects in a way that is fast and memory-efficient. Powered by and named for Immutable.js's _per_sistent _d_ata _s_tructures.

This is pre-release software. The API is not yet frozen.

## Why do I need this?

You need Perds if you want to take advantage of Immutable.js, but you don't want the friction that comes from converting Immutable.js objects into plain JavaScript objects at the boundaries.

## Usage

## Alternatives

### Immer

Immer is awesome. Like Perds, it has persistent data structures with plain JavaScript semantics. It uses a different backing store.
