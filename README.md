# Perds

Haply this is the immutable collections library you need. Work with frozen arrays and objects in a way that is fast and memory-efficient. Powered by and named for Immutable.js's _per_sistent _d_ata _s_tructures.

## Warning

This is pre-release software. The functionality is not complete. The API is not yet frozen.

## Why do I need this?

You need Perds if you want to take advantage of Immutable.js, but you don't want the friction that comes from converting Immutable.js objects into plain JavaScript objects at the boundaries.
